# [CS:GO] AMMO BOX FIX 1.1
Replacement/solution for the broken class *_game_player_equip_*. Weapons are now being refilled by this plugin as before the [CS:GO update 2017-08-17](http://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/2017/08/19239/). This problem has also been [reported](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/csgo-osx-linux/issues/1500) to Valve.

## Cvars
  - `sm_ammobox_fix_enabled` `1` - *_Enabled or disabled [1/0]._*
  - `sm_ammobox_fix_extrarefill` `1.5` - *_Some maps refil ammo slowly this can be used to smooth it out. Enter in seconds. (0=Disabled, 0.1 to 5.0 secs)._*
  
## Tested and works on the maps:
  - ze_castlevania_p1_7
  - ze_ffxiv_wanderers_palace_v4_10
  - ze_shroomforest2_b5_e2
  - ze_fapescape_p5  
  - ze_l0v0l_a7_csgo4
  - ze_fapescape_rote_v1_3
  
  It should work on all maps, otherwise [contact me.](https://github.com/IT-KiLLER/HOW-TO-CONTACT-ME)
